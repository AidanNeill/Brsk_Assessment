   - Download the word list file (words_alpha.txt) from this URL: https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_alpha.txt. Save it in the same directory as the Python script.

2. Running the Program:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you saved the Python script and the word list file. Use the 'cd' command followed by the path to the directory where you saved your Python script and word list file

3. Starting the Program:
   - Run the program by executing the Python script (Enter: python .\Brsk_Assessment.py) in your terminal.
